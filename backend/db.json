He's odd: seeing the world through rose-colored glasses, in denial about personal facts, and convinced he's at war with Satan. The rectory is a half-way house for recently paroled convicts. Adam arrives for 12 weeks, a large, tough neo-Nazi, first baffled by Ivan's thick-headed optimism, then angry. He vows to break Ivan's faith. Meanwhile, in exasperation at Ivan's insistence, Adam sets a personal goal: to bake an apple pie. All goes awry for the tree: crows, worms, lightening. The Book of Job gives Adam perverse insight, and his hooligan mates provide the resolution's spring.",

For the men of 'E' Easy Company the training is particularly difficult as a result of their demanding commander, Captain Herbert Sobel.

While the men are fit and ready for battle, thanks to Sobel, he has unfortunately shown himself to be a weak tactical commander. Once in England, and knowing they will soon be invading the Continent, the sergeants stage a rebellion. Sobel's excesses come to an end when Lt. Dick Winters requests a court martial rather than accept punishment for one of Sobel's lame charges.",
