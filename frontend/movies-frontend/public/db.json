The Spartan defeat was not the one expected, as a local shepherd, named Ephialtes, defected to the Persians and informed Xerxes that the separate path through Thermopylae, which the Persians could use to outflank the Greeks, was not as heavily guarded as they thought.","country":"United States, Canada, Bulgaria, Australia","awards":"19 wins & 55 nominations","posterUrl":{"thumbnail":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWMxYTZlOTUtZDExMi00YzZmLTkwYTMtZmM2MmRjZmQ3OGY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAwMzUyMzUy._V1_SX100.jpg","medium":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWMxYTZlOTUtZDExMi00YzZmLTkwYTMtZmM2MmRjZmQ3OGY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAwMzUyMzUy._V1_SX300.jpg","large":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWMxYTZlOTUtZDExMi00YzZmLTkwYTMtZmM2MmRjZmQ3OGY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAwMzUyMzUy._V1_SX600.jpg"},"ratings":[{"source":"Internet Movie Database","value":"7.6/10"},{"source":"Rotten Tomatoes","value":"61%"},{"source":"Metacritic","value":"52/100"}],"metascore":"52","imdbRating":"7.6","imdbVotes":"759,019","type":"movie","imdbUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416449","__formatted":true,"DVD":"31 Jul 2007","boxOffice":"$210,614,939","production":"N/A","website":"N/A","__finished":true},{"title":"A little bit of heaven","subtitles":"[Danish - Hardcoded]","languages":"[English]","imdbId":"tt1440161","imdbTitle":"A Little Bit of Heaven","year":"2011","releaseYear":2011,"rated":"PG-13","released":"04 May 2012","runtimeMinutes":106,"genres":["Comedy","Drama","Fantasy"],"director":["Nicole Kassell"],"writer":["Gren Wells"],"actors":["Kate Hudson","Gael García Bernal","Kathy Bates"],"plot":"An irreverent young woman who uses her humor to prevent matters from getting serious has a life-changing visit with her doctor.","country":"United States","awards":"N/A","posterUrl":{"thumbnail":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY1MDkzMTc0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODc5NDU1Nw@@._V1_SX100.jpg","medium":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY1MDkzMTc0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODc5NDU1Nw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","large":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY1MDkzMTc0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODc5NDU1Nw@@._V1_SX600.jpg"},"ratings":[{"source":"Internet Movie Database","value":"6.3/10"},{"source":"Rotten Tomatoes","value":"4%"},{"source":"Metacritic","value":"14/100"}],"metascore":"14","imdbRating":"6.3","imdbVotes":"28,342","type":"movie","imdbUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1440161","__formatted":true,"DVD":"05 Jun 2012","boxOffice":"$15,375","production":"N/A","website":"N/A","__finished":true},{"title":"American Psycho","subtitles":"[Danish - Hardcoded]","languages":"[English]","imdbId":"tt0144084","imdbTitle":"American Psycho","year":"2000","releaseYear":2000,"rated":"R","released":"14 Apr 2000","runtimeMinutes":101,"genres":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"director":["Mary Harron"],"writer":["Bret Easton Ellis","Mary Harron","Guinevere Turner"],"actors":["Christian Bale","Justin Theroux","Josh Lucas"],"plot":"It's the late 1980s.

The Monty Python team is trying to sort out the most important question on Earth: what is the meaning of life? They do so by exploring the various stages of life, starting with birth. A doctor seems more interested in his equipment than in delivering the baby or caring for the mother, a Roman Catholic couple have quite a lot of children because \"every sperm is sacred\". In the growing and learning part of life, Catholic schoolboys attend a rather strange church service and ditto sex education lesson. Onto war, where an officer's plan to attack is thwarted by his underlings wanting to celebrate his birthday, and an officer's leg is bitten off by presumably an African tiger. At middle age, a couple orders \"philosophy\" at a restaurant, after which, the movie continues with live organ transplants. The autumn years are played in a restaurant, which, after being treated to the song \"Isn't It Awfully Nice to Have a Penis?\" by an entertainer, sees the arrival of an extremely fat man.

Discovering she was an Umbrella experiment, Alice has been bio-genetically enhanced with new strengths, senses and dexterity--and she will need them. In the heart of the ravaged Raccoon City, a small group of uninfected people, including Jill Valentine, a recently demoted member of Raccoon City's elite Special Tactics and Rescue Services team, and Umbrella Corporation Security Officer Carlos Oliveira, fight for their lives against swarms of Undead and the deadlier and faster Lickers.

Angie Ashford became separated from her father and now hides in fear. Alice, Jill and Carlos will have to fight their way through an army of Undead to save her.

He doesn't really want to be a criminal, but he doesn't share the dreams of his old friends from their working class neighborhood either. They all yearn for the culturally approved 9-to-5 Civil Service jobs with benefit packages that will carry them through weekends of beer into lazy retirement. Brian doesn't want to end up in a soul-numbing job like his buddies, but he's sure he doesn't want to be like his best friend Todd (Zachary Booth) either. Todd has betrayed their blue-collar roots by accepting a scholarship to college. But Brian has a secret -- he's a talented artist. In the basement of the bagel shop beneath his parent's apartment, he creates impressionistic charcoal and watercolor images of the stifling city that surrounds him. When he puts on his headphones and paints, shouting matches between Brian's longshoreman father Paddy (Stephen Lang) and world-weary mother (Karen Allen) fade into the distance. But even his private world can't block out the brutal beatings a drunken Paddy inflicts on Danny. Though Paddy has never been physically abusive to Brian, every time he sees his brother's suffering, his heart breaks a little more. Besides his art, Brian finds respite in working for Whitey (Peter Riegert), a kindly curmudgeon who runs the failing Lafayette movie theater in Bay Ridge. Brian's been helping Whitey pay his debts to local mobster Jimmy Cheeks (Ken Jennings) by bringing in rock groups to play gigs at the theater. With money problems mounting, Whitey decides to call in a lifelong favor from an old friend, now the tour manager of the Rolling Stones. The Stones will stop to play the Lafayette for one hour only on their way to Madison Square Garden...a plan Whitey hopes will solve his loan shark problems forever. The small Brooklyn neighborhood buzzes with anticipation of the Stones' arrival, which gives Brian the courage to talk to pretty Shauna Friel (Leslie Murphy), the girl he was too shy to approach in high school. Shauna, a travel agent, is awaiting transfer to a glamorous new job in Los Angeles, and dreams of traveling the world before she's 25. She and one of Brian's other friends, the college-bound Todd, begin to plant new seeds of hope in Brian's doubtful mind. Perhaps his art could be a ticket for him out of his dead end life and into a future of possibilities. When one excessively violent beating from Paddy convinces Danny he can't stay at home anymore, he tries to enlist Brian in one last scheme - to rob the Lafayette on the night of the Rolling Stones concert. Danny sees this as their only chance to get enough money to skip town and start them both off in a new life, somewhere far away from Brooklyn. As the theater fills with revelers, Brian is torn between his love and loyalty to Danny and his real fondness for Whitey. In the twists and turns that follow, both brothers must reexamine their dreams, and make decisions that will change their lives forever.","country":"United States","awards":"3 wins & 3 nominations","posterUrl":{"thumbnail":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyODA3NDUzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTgzNDA2NA@@._V1_SX100.jpg","medium":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyODA3NDUzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTgzNDA2NA@@._V1_SX300.jpg","large":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyODA3NDUzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTgzNDA2NA@@._V1_SX600.jpg"},"ratings":[{"source":"Internet Movie Database","value":"6.8/10"},{"source":"Rotten Tomatoes","value":"47%"},{"source":"Metacritic","value":"51/100"}],"metascore":"51","imdbRating":"6.8","imdbVotes":"1,825","type":"movie","imdbUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1550524","__formatted":true,"DVD":"28 Jun 2011","boxOffice":"$31,056","production":"N/A","website":"N/A","__finished":true},{"title":"x","subtitles":"[Danish - Hardcoded]","languages":"[English]","imdbId":"tt1661099","imdbTitle":"X","year":"2011","releaseYear":2011,"rated":"Not Rated","released":"24 Nov 2011","runtimeMinutes":90,"genres":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"director":["Jon Hewitt"],"writer":["Belinda McClory","Jon Hewitt"],"actors":["Viva Bianca","Hanna Mangan Lawrence","Peter Docker"],"plot":"Holly Rowe's retiring, kissing her callgirl life goodbye.

His association with the role took over his life, where Birdman is more renowned than \"Riggan Thomson\" the actor. Now past middle age, Riggan is trying to establish himself as a true artist by writing, directing, starring in and co-producing with his best friend Jake what is his Broadway debut, an adaptation of Raymond Carver's story, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. He is staking his name, what little artistic reputation that comes with that name and his life savings on the project, and as such will do anything needed to make the play a success. As he and Jake go through the process of the previews toward opening night, Riggan runs into several issues: needing to find a replacement for the integral supporting male role the night before the first preview; hiring the talented Broadway name, Mike Shiner, for that role, Mike who ends up being difficult to work with and who may end up overshadowing Riggan in the play; having to deal potentially with a lawsuit based on one of his actions to ensure success; needing to be there for his daughter, Sam, who he has hired to be his production assistant and who has just come out of drug rehab; and pleasing the New York Times critic, Tabitha Dickinson, who wants to use any excuse to give the play a scathing review which in turn would close the show after the opening night performance. But Riggan's biggest problem may be his own insecurities, which are manifested by him constantly hearing what he believes to be the truth from the voice of his Birdman character, who he often battles both internally and externally.","country":"United States","awards":"Won 4 Oscars. 193 wins & 291 nominations total","posterUrl":{"thumbnail":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODAzNDMxMzAxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxMjA4MjE@._V1_SX100.jpg","medium":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODAzNDMxMzAxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxMjA4MjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","large":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODAzNDMxMzAxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxMjA4MjE@._V1_SX600.jpg"},"ratings":[{"source":"Internet Movie Database","value":"7.7/10"},{"source":"Rotten Tomatoes","value":"91%"},{"source":"Metacritic","value":"87/100"}],"metascore":"87","imdbRating":"7.7","imdbVotes":"602,842","type":"movie","imdbUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2562232","__formatted":true,"DVD":"17 Feb 2015","boxOffice":"$42,340,598","production":"N/A","website":"N/A","__finished":true},{"title":"Brick Mansions","subtitles":"[English]","languages":"[English]","imdbId":"tt1430612","imdbTitle":"Brick Mansions","year":"2014","releaseYear":2014,"rated":"PG-13","released":"25 Apr 2014","runtimeMinutes":90,"genres":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"director":["Camille Delamarre"],"writer":["Luc Besson","Bibi Naceri","Ryan Amon"],"actors":["Paul Walker","David Belle","RZA"],"plot":"In a future where Detroit's most dangerous criminals occupy the city's deserted brick mansions, an undercover cop joins forces with an ex-convict to defeat the notorious drug kingpin who has taken the mayor hostage.

In late 2005, in the still short time their group of friends has included Robin, she is onto yet another guy (this time a multi-multi-millionaire) while Ted has barely had any women. Barney thinks it's because Ted over-analyzes every situation.

To prove a point, Ted does down all five believing they will have no effect on him.

Marshall, Lily and Barney are only able to fill in a part of the puzzle. As the four go on a quest to figure out the remainder of the puzzle (with Marshall fixating on the pineapple), the journey may start with the message on Ted's right arm.

He refuses to take the job as an architecture professor since he sees that as a failure of not being an actual architect. So he takes the only design job offered to him: to design a restaurant, a rib joint, in the shape of a cowboy hat. For three solid days, this job is the focus of his life to the exclusion of all else including celebrating his birthday (much to his friends' chagrin, they who planned a surprise party for him on the rooftop). But Lily's pet goat throws a small wrench into Ted's life. Up on the roof, Marshall is contemplating making the literal six or seven foot horizontal leap to the roof of the adjacent building (where there is an inviting hot tub), missing which would mean falling several stories to the ground. Although he's thought about doing it for years, he seems closer now to doing it than ever. And Barney thinks that he's in love with Robin and plans on telling her so, until Robin pulls a \"Mosby\" on him.","country":"United States","awards":"N/A","posterUrl":{"thumbnail":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MTY5NDc4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQ2NDY1Mg@@._V1_SX100.jpg","medium":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MTY5NDc4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQ2NDY1Mg@@._V1_SX300.jpg","large":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MTY5NDc4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQ2NDY1Mg@@._V1_SX600.jpg"},"ratings":[{"source":"Internet Movie Database","value":"8.7/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"8.7","imdbVotes":"3412","type":"episode","imdbUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1425523","__formatted":true,"seriesId":"tt0460649","season":4,"episode":24,"__finished":true},{"title":"Insurgent","subtitles":"[English]","languages":"[English]","imdbId":"tt2908446","imdbTitle":"Insurgent","year":"2015","releaseYear":2015,"rated":"PG-13","released":"20 Mar 2015","runtimeMinutes":119,"genres":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"director":["Robert Schwentke"],"writer":["Brian Duffield","Akiva Goldsman","Mark Bomback"],"actors":["Shailene Woodley","Ansel Elgort","Theo James"],"plot":"As she searches for allies and answers in the wake of the uprising, Tris and Four are on the run.

As the telling continues, we learn how Adam and Eve's sins have passed down through generations through their sons Cain and Abel, and how the descendants of their righteous sibling Seth were entrusted with defending creation. One day, while foraging in the country, a descendant of Seth, Noah, sees his father slain by a descendant of Cain. In the process, Noah's birthright is stolen from him. Decades later, as a father of three, Noah experiences a vision foretelling the great flood that will wash over the Earth, destroying every living thing that stands on the soil. That vision leads Noah to seek out his grandfather, Methuselah (Sir Anthony Hopkins), in order to understand his mission. When a second vision reveals that Noah is to construct a massive ark designed to shelter every living animal during the great flood, Noah, his wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly), their three sons Shem (Douglas Booth), Ham (Logan Lerman), and Japheth (Leo McHugh Carroll), and their adoptive sister Ila (Emma Watson) immediately begin construction on the vessel with the help of the Watchers, a race of angels created as beings of light, but encrusted in stone and mud and forsaken by God for their attempts to help man. Meanwhile, word of Noah's work soon reaches Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone), who gathers an army on a mission to overtake the ark, and survive the coming storm by any cost.","country":"United States","awards":"1 win & 19 nominations","posterUrl":{"thumbnail":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2OTgyNTc0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDM1NTQxMTE@._V1_SX100.jpg","medium":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2OTgyNTc0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDM1NTQxMTE@._V1_SX300.jpg","large":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2OTgyNTc0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDM1NTQxMTE@._V1_SX600.jpg"},"ratings":[{"source":"Internet Movie Database","value":"5.7/10"},{"source":"Rotten Tomatoes","value":"76%"},{"source":"Metacritic","value":"68/100"}],"metascore":"68","imdbRating":"5.7","imdbVotes":"249,262","type":"movie","imdbUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1959490","__formatted":true,"DVD":"29 Jul 2014","boxOffice":"$101,200,044","production":"N/A","website":"N/A","__finished":true},{"title":"Non Stop","subtitles":"[None]","languages":"[English]","imdbId":"tt2024469","imdbTitle":"Non-Stop","year":"2014","releaseYear":2014,"rated":"PG-13","released":"28 Feb 2014","runtimeMinutes":106,"genres":["Action","Mystery","Thriller"],"director":["Jaume Collet-Serra"],"writer":["John W.

Warriors from Asgard stopped them, but their leader Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) escaped to wait for another opportunity. The warriors find the Aether, and since it cannot be destroyed, they try to hide it. In the present day, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) awaits the return of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), although it has been two years since they last saw once another. In the meantime, Thor has been trying to bring peace to the nine realms. Jane discovers an anomaly similar to the one that brought Thor to Earth. She goes to investigate, finds a wormhole, and is sucked into it. Back on Asgard, Thor wishes to return to Earth, but his father, Odin (Sir Anthony Hopkins), refuses to let him. Thor learns from Heimdall (Idris Elba), who can see into all of the realms, that Jane disappeared. Thor then returns to Earth just as Jane reappears. However, when some Policemen try to arrest her, an unknown energy repulses them. Thor then brings Jane to Asgard to find out what happened to her. When the energy is released again, they discover that when Jane disappeared, she crossed paths with the Aether and it entered her. Malekith, upon sensing that the time to strike is now, seeks out the Aether. He attacks Asgard and Thor's mother Frigga (Rene Russo) is killed protecting Jane.
